Hi There!

I am a (learning) coder, and I love to use Python 🐍

## Projects
dimensional_graphics: My 3D software renderer. It uses pygame-ce and is my favorite project. 🧊

simple-socket: My wrapper for TCP sockets. It is mostly abandoned but was fun to make. 💻

## Interests
While I love coding, I also have an interest in robotics, circuits, and hardware. I've made countless electronic experiments and spend a lot of time learning about them. 🤖

## Goals
~~World Domination 🌎~~
