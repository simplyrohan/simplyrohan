Hi There!

I am a (learning) coder, and I love to use Python 🐍 and C/C++

I work on several fields like web development, and IoT hardware and software

## Projects
`dimensional_graphics`: My 3D software renderer. It's built with Python but I've made a port to C/C++ for embedded systems (`dimensional_embedded`)

`simple-socket`: My wrapper for TCP sockets. It is mostly abandoned but was fun to make. 💻

## Interests
While I love coding, I also have an interest in robotics, circuits, and hardware. I've made countless electronic experiments and spend a lot of time learning about them. 🤖

## Goals
~~World Domination 🌎~~
