I'm a learning coder. I mainly script in Python but sometimes touch on HTML/CSS for my websites.

## Projects
I find interest in home automation and IoT. I am contributing to IoT and home automation packages such as [arlo](). I am also making my own packages like [simple-socket](). You can always look at my repositories for yourself if your interested.

## Interests
I mainly program during my free time, but I also have an interest in robotics. From time to time I pull out my Arduino to build a wild invention I thought up.

## Future Plans
I hope to be a full time developer in the future. I imagine myself as either a game developer or a software developer.
