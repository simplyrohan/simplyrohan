# I am Rohan Gupta ðŸ‘‹

## Technologies I use the most

  - Flask

- Javascript (Vanilla)
- C/C++
  - Arduino Framework + ESP-IDF
  
## Projects
`dimensional_graphics`: My 3D software renderer. It's built with Python but I've made a port to C/C++ for embedded systems (`dimensional_embedded`)

`simple-socket`: My wrapper for TCP sockets (and also my first mildly useful project). It is abandoned but was fun to make. ðŸ’»

`ultratabs`: A powerful webproxy based on the Arc Browser

`retro-card`: A portable retro console emulation firmware for ESP32s

`ti-python`: A compiler from Python 3 to TI-BASIC

## Interests
While I love coding, I also have an interest in robotics, circuits, and hardware. 
I love tinkering with small microcontrollers and SoCs (like the ESP32) and making systems or other cool devices.
 - I've made a tiny Nintendo Entertainment System emulator
 - I've created an embeddable 3D rendering pipeline

## Experience
 - I've interned at Nize LLC and led a product for automating attendance in class
 - I've participated in several Hackathons, both in-person and online, as well as game jams
